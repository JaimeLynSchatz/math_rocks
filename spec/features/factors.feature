Feature: Factors
  In order to determine the Greatest Common Divisor of two numbers
  As a CLI
  I want to be as objective as possible

  Scenario: The GCD of 2 and 4 is 2
    When I run " something here TODO "
    Then the output should contain "2"

  Scenario: Quotient, or Quotient?
    When I run "math_rocks pluralize --word Quotient"
    Then the output should contain "Quotients"
